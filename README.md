The data here was used in a study by Obando et al. 2022 (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0850)

The data in raw form can be obtained from https://rs.figshare.com/collections/Supplementary_material_from_Temporal_exponential_random_graph_models_of_longitudinal_brain_networks_after_stroke_/5803613

The three time stamps used here is week 2, month 3 and year 1

The experimental data were taken after permission from a longitudinal cohort of stroke patients and healthy subjects used in a recently published study https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1521083113

49 first time stroke patients with complete longitudinal scans and clinical scores of motor, language, attention, visual or memory deficits and a group of demographically matched healthy controls. 

All subjects were recruited and underwent the same neuroimaging and behavioural exams at the Washington University School of Medicine. Stroke patients had three longitudinal
visits, i.e. 2 weeks, 3 months and 1 year after the stroke onset. Healthy controls only had two longitudinal visits at a distance of about 3 months. 
Neuropsychological behavioural data were measured by assessing six different functional domains, i.e. (i) spatial attention assessing visual attention to the contralesional hemifield, (ii) spatial memory, (iii) verbal memory, (iv) global language both comprehension and production, (v) contralesional motor and (vi) contralesional visual field.
